We're all fairly puzzled - even if it did break out of its capsule, someone had to have deactivated the security system in order to open the doors for it to escape. I can personally account for everyone with the security codes that night, as they were all at the sushi-appreciation event."

J-11 was rather unnerving - I know some of the research associates claim it had been developing some form of sapience, but we all know that's nonsense. Senior management has assured us that they'll deal with the problem, and to get on with our work. I'm inclined to agree."
